Interface Segregation Principle
 
This principle states that no client should be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
The interface should contain only the necessary abstract method and not more than that.
This principle include imposing the client with the burden of implementing methods that they don't 
acutally need or use. The interface with many additional useless methods are called fat interface.
This type of interface are less re-usable and the useless methods in interface leads to high coupling 
between classes.
